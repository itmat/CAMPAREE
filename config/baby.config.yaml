# Configuration File for CAMPAREE (v0.4.1)
# This config file is prepared to work with the "baby genome" included with
# the CAMPAREE install. The baby genome and test data are derived from short
# (280KB-1MB) segments of mouse (GRCm38/mm10) chromosomes 1, 2, 3, X, and Y,
# as well as the entire mitochondrial chromosome. The baby genome is provided
# both as an example for the user, and as a diagnostic tool to test the
# CAMPAREE install.
#
# Everything listed below is required, except for those labeled [OPTIONAL].
# To remove optional arguments, they can be commented out by placing a "#"
# at the beginning of the line.

### General attributes for running CAMPAREE
setup:
    # Alpha-numeric ID (including underscores) assigned to the CAMPAREE run.
    # Used to name output directories. If specified on command line with the
    # "-r" argument, it will override the value here.
    run_id: 1

    # [OPTIONAL] Integer value used to see random number generator used in
    # various CAMPAREE steps. Used for reproducibility.
    seed: 100

    # The method used to submit jobs for processing. If specified on command
    # line with the "-m" argument, it will override the value here. Currently
    # supports "serial" (single-core), "lsf" (distributed LSF system), "sge"
    # (distributed SGE system), and "batch" (AWS batch). Case-sensitive.
    # Other modes may be added in later releases.
    scheduler_mode: serial

    # [OPTIONAL] Specify the number of processors and the amount of RAM (in Mb)
    # the scheduler should request by default when submitting jobs. These values
    # are ignored if the scheduler_mode is set to "serial". The values specified
    # here can also be overridden for specific steps in the pipeline that may
    # require more/fewer resources than the default values. See the "steps"
    # sections of this config file for further details.
    default_scheduler_parameters:
        default_num_processors: 1
        default_memory_in_mb: 6000
        # Specify any additional arguments to provide to the scheduler when
        # submitting the job. This will not be needed in most cases and is
        # supported to give advanced users greater control over the submission
        # commands.
        default_submission_args:

    # [OPTIONAL] The maximum number of times a failed job/step will attempt
    # to repeat before the entire CAMPAREE run halts. This must be an integer
    # greater than or equal to 0. A value of 0 for this parameter means
    # CAMPAREE will not attempt to resubmit failed jobs before halting.
    # [DEFAULT: 3]
    # job_resub_limit: 3

### System locations for genome annotation resources used by CAMPAREE
# See https://camparee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resource_files.html for detailed
# information about the organization of the CAMPAREE resources directory.
resources:
    # [OPTIONAL] Path to upper-level directory containing genome sequence,
    # annotation info, and STAR index directory. If not provided, defaults to
    # resources directory contained in the CAMPAREE install directory.
    # directory_path:

    # Alpha-numeric (including underscores and periods) name of organism and
    # genome/annotation version. Used as sub-directory to the resources path.
    species_model: baby_genome.mm10

    # Sub-directory name containing STAR index files This index must be built
    # using a version of STAR compatible with v2.5.2a. Also, the chromosome
    # names used in the index must match those used by the reference FASTA and
    # annotation files below. A compressed copy of the STAR index for the baby
    # genome is packaged with the CAMPAREE install for testing purposes. It must
    # be extracted before CAMPAREE can use it to run on the baby genome data.
    star_genome_index_directory_name: star_index.genome

    # FASTA file containing complete genome sequence. Each chromosome sequence
    # must be on a single line. To generate files in this format from multi-line
    # FASTA files, use the bin/format_reference_files_for_camparee.py utility
    # script. If ends in ".gz", will be treated as a gzipped file.
    reference_genome_filename: baby_genome.mm10.oneline_seqs.fa

    # File containing coordinates for each transcript in the annotation. This
    # file can be built from a GTF using the bin/format_reference_files_for_camparee.py
    # script. Chromosome names in this file must match those used in the reference
    # genome FASTA.
    annotation_filename: baby_genome.mm10.annotation.txt

    # File containing a list of chromosome names and the number of homologous
    # copies for each gender in the species. Chromosome names must match those
    # in the reference genome FASTA and annotation files, but may be a subset.
    # Only the chromosomes specified in this file are used to generate
    # simulated transcripts. See
    # https://camparee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resource_files.html#chromosome-ploidy-file
    # for full details on how to create ploidy file, and how it is used. The
    # bin/format_reference_files_for_camparee.py script also has the option to
    # create a starting ploidy file that will need to be edited to account for
    # non-diploid organisms and non-autosomal chromosomes.
    chr_ploidy_filename: baby_genome.mm10.chr_ploidy.txt

### Information concerning input samples
input:
    # Path to directory containing FASTQ files for all samples. Fastq files for
    # the baby genome dataset are packaged in the CAMPAREE install directory.
    fastq_directory_path: test_data/fastq_files/

    ### Optional input files used across all samples
    # While CAMPAREE will infer/phase genetic variants, and estimate various
    # empirical distributions from the input data, users have the option to
    # specify their own versions of these data. This section of the config file
    # is where users direct CAMPAREE to the locations of the files containing
    # pre-computed data/distributions prepared by the user. Each entry below
    # will describe the type and/or format of the file CAMPAREE requires to use
    # the optional input. Specifying these optional inputs may skip associated
    # steps in the CAMPAREE pipeline (e.g. CAMPAREE will not repeat genotype
    # phasing if provided with a phased vcf file). Lastly, as the name of this
    # section implies, all entries here are optional.
    optional_inputs:
        # [OPTIONAL] Path to directory containing BAM files for all samples. Note,
        # BAM files are only read from here. If CAMPAREE performs the alignment,
        # the resulting BAM files are saved to the output directory (specified
        # below).
        #bam_directory_path:
        # [OPTIONAL] VCF file containing phased genotypes for each sample. The
        # sample genotype columns must use the same names as the samples they
        # correspond to (e.g. sample1, sample2, etc.). The format of this input
        # file is not currently checked to make sure it matches beagle output
        # exactly. We plan to add checks of the VCF file's format in future
        # releases of CAMPAREE. Lastly, the VCF file will be treated as
        # gzipped if its name ends with '.gz'.
        #phased_vcf_file:

    ### Per-sample information (input files, attributes)
    data:
        # Alpha-numeric name (including underscores) for each sample. This
        # will be used to name the output directory specific to this sample.
        'Test_Sample_1':
            # Names for the forward and reverse fastq files (order matters).
            # Both forward and reverse must be provided, and they must have
            # been generated using a strand-specific protocol (both of these
            # requirements will be removed in later releases).
            fastq_files:
                - Test_Sample_1.forward.fq.gz

            # Was RNA-seq library was created from a pool of individuals? If so,
            # it is not feasible to infer parental genotypes from variants
            # contained in the RNA-seq data. Setting this to 'True' will skip
            # all variant-calling, phasing, parental genome construction, and
            # allele-specific quantification operations in the CAMPAREE pipeline.
            # Simulated transcripts will effectively be generated from the
            # haploid reference genome.
            pooled: False
            # Gender of the input samples. This will be used in combination with
            # the chromosome ploidy file to determine which chromosomes have
            # homologous pairs, and should therefore show allele-specific
            # expression.  If gender is unknown, the value can be set to 'null'
            # but certain chromosomes will not be included.
            gender: male
            # [OPTIONAL] Number of RNA transcript molecules to simulate for this
            # sample. CAMPAREE will use the default molecule count (specified in
            # the 'output' section of this config file) if no molecule count is
            # provided at the sample level, or if it is overridden in the
            # 'output' section of this config file.
            molecule_count: 10000

            ### Per-sample optional input files
            # This section allows users to provide CAMPAREE with pre-computed
            # empirical distributions and intermediate files specific to
            # individual samples. As with the other optional_inputs section
            # defined above, providing files here may allow CAMPAREE to skip
            # steps in the pipeline for this subject (e.g. CAMPAREE will not
            # repeat genome alignment given an aligned BAM file). Again, all
            # entries in this section are optional.
            optional_inputs:
                # [OPTIONAL] STAR-aligned BAM files generated from the same FASTQ
                # files listed above. Must have been aligned using the
                # '--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate' option (or some other means

                # [OPTIONAL] Tab-delimited text file describing gene-level
                # distribution of reads. This file is normally created by the

                # empirical estimate of gene signal. Note, providing this file
                # will only skip the associated steps in the pipeline if the
                # 'psi_quant' file (see below) is also provided, since these are
                # both generated by the same steps in the pipeline.
                #gene_quant:
                # [OPTIONAL] Tab-delimited text file describing the distribution
                # of PSI (percent splicing included) values across all transcripts.
                # PSI values are the percentage of reads from a gene that originate
                # for each transcript associated with that gene. This file is
                # normally created by the CAMPAREE TranscriptGeneQuantificationStep
                # and provides an empirical estimate of alternative splicing.
                # Note, providing this file will only skip the associated steps
                # in the pipeline if the 'gene_quant' file (see above) is also
                # provided, since these are both generated by the same steps in
                # the pipeline.
                #psi_quant:
                # [OPTIONAL] Tab-delimited text file describing the gene-level
                # distribution of reads originating from each parental allele.
                # This file is normally created by the CAMPAREE

    directory_path: test_data/results/
    # The format of the CAMPAREE molecule output. Should be either 'file' or
    # 'packet'.
    # file: creates a raw text file of the molecules, their source locations on
    #       the parental and reference genomes, and the CIGAR strings mapping the
    #       molecules on the parental and reference genomes.
    # packet: A binary file of molecule information suitable for use by the BEERS2

### Configuration of individual steps in the CAMPAREE pipeline
# CAMPAREE uses this list to assemble all of its pipeline components. Therefore,
# All steps used in the CAMPAREE pipeline *MUST* be listed here, even if they do
# not require any specialized run parameters. While users may wish to tweak the
# run parameters for the various steps listed below, the names of the steps
# should not be changed or removed. If any of the steps require resources (i.e.
# number of processors/cores, RAM) from the job scheduler that differ from the
# defaults, users may specify these for each step, as needed.
steps:
    # Align FASTQ files to reference genome using STAR v2.5.2a. Output alignments
    # in BAM format, sorted by chromosome coordinate. Note that while this step
    # is skipped if the user provides BAM files, this entry should not be removed
